#Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Prediction
##Tessa Clary

## Project Description

This project explores prediction factors of Alzheimer's Disease via the impact of related demographic factors on cognitive decline. It involved the usage of data mining and machine learning techniques to understand the influence of age, gender, and race on the progression of cognitive decline.


## Questions
How do demographic factors influence cognitive decline?
Which variables show a significant impact on cognitive decline?


## Answers
Race emerged as a significant factor influencing cognitive decline, while gender and age showed minimal impact.
The quality of the data collected by the BRFSS can be called into question given the results of the models.


## Application of Knowledge
The possible impact of the results of the project can have a multitude of potential applications:
Improved diagnosis and early intervention for individuals at higher risk.
Tailored healthcare strategies considering demographic influences.
Better allocation of resources and research focus in Alzheimer's Disease studies
A deeper examination of the dataset may be required by those who created it in order to discover and remove hidden biases in the data.


## Video Demonstration
I apologize for this aspect of the project, I have been dealing with laryngitis recently and was unable to make a voice recording of decent quality. If there is anything else I can provide for you at this stage due to this shortcoming, please do not hesitate to reach out.
